Overview
========

The GameSpyProfileAuthentication sample authenticates a GameSpy profile via the
AuthService (webservices) SDK using the profile's uniquenick and password. This
is a prerequisite for using many of our SDKs, such as Sake and ATLAS. You can
run the Release configuration to avoid debug output and make it easier to 
follow along.

The user will need to first create a GameSpy profile if he doesn't already have
one. You can either manage creation via the GP SDK or link the user to
gamespyid.com. This account is the same used by IGN, Direct2Drive, FilePlanet,
and many, many games that are powered by GameSpy.

Note: These samples are very simple implementations intended to be used as a 
basic reference to help you learn and implement the SDKs. They are not cross-
platform and don't have Unicode configurations. You can check out the test apps
within each SDK directory for a more thorough conglomeration of cross-platform
calls with Unicode support.
